# IPL-WINING-TEAM-PREDICTION
Leveraging extensive data from IPL matches between 2008 and 2022, I embarked on a journey to predict match outcomes using machine learning. By cleaning and transforming match and ball-by-ball data, I built comprehensive statistics for batsmen and bowlers, enabling me to cluster players based on performance. This allowed for a detailed analysis and insight generation.
Using Python and libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I developed a predictive model. The Random Forest Classifier, part of my machine learning toolkit, powered this model, delivering promising results in predicting match outcomes based on real-time data inputs.
This project has been a fantastic experience in data science and machine learning, showcasing the potential of these technologies in sports analytics. I'm eager to continue refining this model and exploring further applications.
